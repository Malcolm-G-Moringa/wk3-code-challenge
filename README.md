# wk3-code-challenge

## Description
This project is a web app named **Flatdango**, a m ovie application that is used to display information to a user about the different movies available and allowing the user to purchase tickets for a movie.\
The app is created to satisfy a code-challenge by Moringa School. The app uses JSON-server so as to setup the db.json file found in the project folder to act as the web-app's server.\
The app utilizes the fetch() javascript function to retrieve and post data to the db.json file, while using events to trigger correspnding actions.
